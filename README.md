# FT4_FT8_RTTY_DDS_Signal_Generation
Direct RF signal generation of FT4, FT8 and RTTY using an AD9851 DDS and Arduino Nano

This is a sub-set of the larger project https://github.com/Rich5252/SDR-Plugin_TXlink_WSJT-X

TXlink4_Nano.ino is the main file here that includes further descriptions.

This version includes FT4 & FT8 gaussian tone transitions and optimised handling of late TX initiation cases.
